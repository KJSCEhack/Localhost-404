To make an application portal where citizens can report their problems on the streets of Mumbai. 
It marks its location and follows up about it.

Key features and Functionality:
Login account for citizens and ward authorities.
Reporting problems by citizens.
Adding comments to these comments by other users
Displaying each problem (on being clicked on it), along with the associated comments and also its geolocation. 
Providing the citizen the feature to edit the problem.
Displaying the affected areas on an embedded map.
Tagging problems as Ongoing or Resolved. Resolved feature can only be done by the Ward authority.

Future Plan:
Make profiles for all the wards and citizens having an account, showing them the problems in their ward and problems reported by them respectively.
After an issue has been closed, do not delete it but hide it. If the work done proves to be shoddy it can be flagged again.
Adding all resolved problems to success page, showing the progress of the portal.
